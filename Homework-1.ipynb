    "Your goal is develop a code to discretize the reservoir into rectangular grid blocks on a Cartesian grid and then assign a thickness and depth to each grid. For now, you can nominally use 54*44 (2376) grids but your code should be flexible enough to allow for any number of grids in the x- and y- directions. In fact, it should also allow for non-uniform grid sizes (but still rectangular/Cartesian).\n",

    "The first step is to use some sort of digitizing software to extract the depths and thicknesses from the provided contour plots. Note that there are several different free digitizing software on the internet. A simple Matlab add-in called “grabit” can help make determining x and y values of points on contour lines easy.\n",
